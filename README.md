# Key-Logger-Python
Keylogger is the tools that record what a person types on a device. It is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly,
so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.
